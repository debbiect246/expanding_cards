# Expanding cards
This project is a part of the 50 projects in 50 days challenge.
I am working hard to produce 50 projects in 50 days using a udemy
video.  I will be brushing up on my HTML, CSS and javascript skills.
I completed a bootcamp with Code Institute almost a year ago and
since then I have been busy coding on and off and developing my
teaching business.  The time is right now to get on with moving on
with my coding skills.  It's amazing in a year what I have forgotten
or just got rusty on and I really need to go back over stuff I learnt
last year.  I really enjoy coding and creating websites and apps for 
people to use.  I used to find it really hard but now it's just hard, 
although I have to admit that some parts are easy now!  

This project is project 1 out of 50 and will involve using HTML,
CSS and javascript to produce a page of cards that expand and 
retract when clicked!  I know that I will be able to use this code
in future larger projects as well.

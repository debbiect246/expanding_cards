# Expanding cards
This project is a part of the 50 projects in 50 days challenge.
I am working hard to produce 50 projects in 50 days using a udemy
video.  I will be brushing up on my HTML, CSS and javascript skills.
I completed a bootcamp with Code Institute almost a year ago and
since then I have been busy coding on and off and developing my
teaching business.  The time is right now to get on with moving on
with my coding skills.  It's amazing in a year what I have forgotten
or just got rusty on and I really need to go back over stuff I learnt
last year.  I really enjoy coding and creating websites and apps for 
people to use.  I used to find it really hard but now it's just hard, 
although I have to admit that some parts are easy now!  

This project is project 1 out of 50 and will involve using HTML,
CSS and javascript to produce a page of cards that expand and 
retract when clicked!  I know that I will be able to use this code
in future larger projects as well.

# Technologies used
I created this project using HTML, CSS, javascript and jquery.

# User stories
1. User sees a number of cards on screen lined up vertically.
2. User can click on a card and it expands to show full picture.
3. User clicks on another card and previous card retracts and new card is shown on screen.

# Inspiration for idea
I took my inspiration for this idea from Brad Travesky's udemy course on 50 projects in
50 days.   Although I cannot claim this as my own idea, I can see many uses for this project
in other projects - eg. cards could be used to display testimonials or maths examples - I am
a maths teacher and teach maths so I can see this idea being useful for my students, but I would
need to replace pictures with images.

# Steps taken to complete the project
1. Create HTML boiler plate and outline.
2. Create CSS file and add in relevant classes.
3. Add in javascript file to control user interactivity with cards.

# Improvements that could be made
1. User could add comments on each card.
2. User could add their own cards and these could be shown after moderation by a moderator.
